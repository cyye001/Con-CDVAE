# MP-20

MP-20 contains 45231 general inorganic materials that differ in both structure and composition. There are 89 elements and the materials have 1 - 20 atoms in the unit cells. MP-20 includes most experimentally known materials with no more than 20 atoms in unit cell.

## What is in the dataset

MP-20 includes almost all experimentally stable materials from the Materials Project (Jain et al., 2013) with unit cells including at most 20 atoms. We only include materials that are originally from ICSD (Belsky et al., 2002) to ensure the experimental stability, and these materials represent the majority of experimentally known materials with at most 20 atoms in unit cells.

## Stability of curated materials

All 45231 are experimentally synthesizable. All materials are at local energy minimum after DFT relaxation. In addition, we only select materials with energy above the hull smaller than 0.08 eV/atom and formation energy smaller than 2 eV/atom.
